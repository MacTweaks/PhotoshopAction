This will cause the GUI to display what look like glitches because the modified files will not be the right dimensions. Only test a few folders each time so that you can still navigate properly.

I split the artfiles folder into groups and then added them to ArtFile.bin sequentially to narrow down on what folders have effected which elements and so that I could still navigate the interface.
